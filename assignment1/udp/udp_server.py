"""
Implement a simple acknowledgement protocol that you assign unique sequence id for each package you send to the server.
Once the package is received by the server, the server will send acknowledgement back to the client.
In case of package lost, the client did not receive the acknowledgement back from the server,
the client must resend the same package again until you get the acknowledgement.
To control the package order, the client will never send the next package until it gets the acknowledegement for the previous one.
